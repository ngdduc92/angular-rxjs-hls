# Customize video controls with NodeJS, Typescript, Angular, HLS, RxJS, @ngrx/store
This is a small single page application (SPA) for playing videos with custom controls. This application has been written in TypeScript using an MVVM architecture and built in the Redux style with Angular 6, RxJS, ngrx/store, and HLS. RxJS is to handle asynchronous calls with multiple events.  
@ngrx/store is a controlled state container designed to help write performant, consistent applications on top of Angular.  
HLS is designed for reliability and dynamically adapts to network conditions by optimizing playback for the available speed of wired and wireless connections.
